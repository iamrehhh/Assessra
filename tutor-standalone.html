            response: "Great question! So, marketing is basically how businesses figure out what people want and then convince them to buy it. Think of it like this - imagine you're throwing a party. Marketing is finding out what music your friends like, what snacks they prefer, and then making sure they know about your awesome party!",
            followUp: "It's more than just selling stuff - it's about understanding people. Want me to break down the different parts of marketing, or explain how companies actually use it?"
        },
        
        detailed: {
            response: "Let me dive deeper into marketing for you! \n\nMarketing is really a whole process that businesses use. Here's how it works:\n\n**Understanding Customers:** First, companies do research to figure out what people actually want. Like, Netflix watches what shows you binge to recommend more stuff you'll love.\n\n**Market Segmentation:** Then they divide customers into groups. For example, Apple targets tech-savvy people who value design, not everyone.\n\n**The Marketing Mix (4Ps):** This is the fun part!\n- **Product:** What you're selling (iPhone's features)\n- **Price:** How much it costs (premium pricing strategy)\n- **Place:** Where you sell it (Apple Stores, online)\n- **Promotion:** How you advertise it (those sleek commercials)\n\n**Goals:** Companies want things like more sales, brand loyalty, and happy customers.\n\nDoes this make sense? Want a real-world example or more details on any specific part?",
            followUp: "I can explain market segmentation in detail, talk about the 4Ps with examples, or show you how a company like Coca-Cola uses marketing. What interests you?"
        },
        
        example: {
            response: "Let me give you a real example! \n\nTake **Apple** - they're marketing masters:\n\n**Research:** They noticed people wanted phones that were simple and beautiful, not complicated.\n\n**Segmentation:** They target premium customers who value design over low prices.\n\n**Product:** iPhones with sleek design and easy-to-use interface.\n\n**Price:** High prices (£999+) to signal quality and exclusivity.\n\n**Place:** Fancy Apple Stores with minimalist design, plus their website.\n\n**Promotion:** Simple ads that focus on emotion and design, not technical specs.\n\n**Result:** People camp outside stores for new iPhones! That's successful marketing.\n\nSee how all the pieces work together? Want another example or should we explore a different topic?",
            followUp: "I can compare Apple's strategy with a different company, or we can move to another business topic. Your call!"
        }
    },

    segmentation: {

        simple: {
            response: "Market segmentation is like organizing your friends into groups! You wouldn't invite your gaming friends to a book club, right? \n\nBusinesses do the same thing - they split customers into groups based on things like age, interests, or how much money they have. Then they market differently to each group. Makes sense?",
            followUp: "Want to know the different ways companies group customers, or see some real examples?"
        },
        
        detailed: {
            response: "Okay, let me explain market segmentation properly!\n\nImagine you're selling sneakers. You can't market the same way to everyone, so you divide customers:\n\n**Demographic:** Age, gender, income\n- Example: Kids want trendy colors, adults want comfort\n\n**Geographic:** Where they live\n- Example: Warm countries need light shoes, cold countries need insulated ones\n\n**Psychographic:** Lifestyle and values\n- Example: Athletes want performance, fashion lovers want style\n\n**Behavioral:** Shopping habits\n- Example: Loyal customers get discounts, new customers get welcome offers\n\nNike does this brilliantly - they have different lines for basketball players, runners, and casual wearers. Each group gets targeted ads that speak to THEIR needs.\n\nMake sense? Want real examples or more detail on any type?",
            followUp: "I can show you how a specific company uses segmentation, or explain why it's so important. What would help you most?"
        },
        
        example: {
            response: "Here's a perfect example - **Netflix**!\n\nThey segment like crazy:\n\n**Demographics:** \n- Kids get animated shows\n- Teens get teen dramas\n- Adults get serious content\n\n**Behavioral:**\n- If you watch crime shows, they recommend more crime\n- Binge-watchers get whole seasons at once\n\n**Geographic:**\n- UK gets British shows promoted\n- India gets Bollywood content\n\n**Result:** Your Netflix homepage looks COMPLETELY different from your friend's! That's segmentation working perfectly - everyone feels like Netflix was made just for them.\n\nPretty clever, right? Want to explore how this helps businesses make more money?",
            followUp: "I can explain the benefits of segmentation, or we can jump to another business concept. You choose!"

        simple: {
            response: "Break-even is super simple - it's the point where a business stops losing money and hasn't made profit yet. Like if you sell lemonade for £1 and it costs you £1 to make, you break even!\n\nBusinesses need to know this number so they know how many sales they need just to survive.",
            followUp: "Want me to explain the math behind it, or show you a real example with numbers?"
        },
        
        detailed: {
            response: "Let me break down break-even analysis for you!\n\n**The Concept:** It's finding out how many products you need to sell before you stop losing money.\n\n**The Costs:**\n- **Fixed Costs:** Stuff you pay no matter what (rent, salaries) - let's say £10,000\n- **Variable Costs:** Costs per item (materials, packaging) - say £5 per item\n- **Selling Price:** What customers pay - say £15 per item\n\n**The Math:**\nBreak-even = Fixed Costs ÷ (Selling Price - Variable Cost)\n= £10,000 ÷ (£15 - £5)\n= £10,000 ÷ £10\n= **1,000 units**\n\nSo you need to sell 1,000 items to break even. Sell 1,001? You're making profit!\n\n**Why It Matters:** \n- Helps set realistic sales targets\n- Shows if your prices are too low\n- Tells you if your business idea is viable\n\nWant me to work through another example with different numbers?",
            followUp: "I can show you how lowering costs or raising prices affects break-even, or we can move to another topic. What works for you?"

Meanwhile, you need to pay your suppliers in 30 days. You're profitable but have no cash - that's a cash flow crisis!\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Demand faster payments from customers\n- Negotiate longer payment terms with suppliers\n- Keep a cash reserve\n- Get a bank overdraft\n\nEven huge companies like **Carillion** went bankrupt because of cash flow problems, even though they had contracts worth millions!\n\nMake sense?

This is why businesses fail.\n\n**Solution:** Get a £10,000 overdraft, or demand 50% upfront from customers.\n\n**Real Example:** Toys R Us went bankrupt partly due to cash flow - they had to pay suppliers before selling toys, especially before Christmas. When sales were slower than expected, they ran out of cash despite owning valuable inventory.\n\nSee why cash is king? Want to explore cash flow management strategies?",

But giving them an exciting project to lead (motivator) will!\n\n**Financial vs Non-Financial:**\n- Financial: Bonuses, commission, profit-sharing\n- Non-Financial: Flexible hours, recognition, training\n\nGoogle uses both - great pay (hygiene) PLUS free food, 20% creative time, and cool projects (motivators).\n\nWant real company examples or more detail on any theory?",

Democratic (Participative):**\n- Team discusses and votes\n- Leader makes final decision but considers input\n- **When to use:** Complex problems, skilled workers, building morale\n- **Example:** Tech startup brainstorming\n- **Problem:** Slow decision-making\n\n**3. Laissez-faire (Hands-off):**\n- Team has full freedom\n- Leader just provides resources\n- **When to use:** Highly skilled experts, creative industries\n- **Example:** Research lab, design agency\n- **Problem:** Can lack direction if team isn't skilled\n\n**Real Insight:** Steve Jobs was autocratic (made all design decisions), but Google is democratic (engineers vote on features).

Employees choose projects\n- Desks have wheels - move to any team\n- **Why it works:** All employees are expert game developers\n- **Result:** Created Half-Life, Portal, Steam - massive successes\n\n**The Lesson:** There's no \"best\" style - it depends on your industry, team skill level, and situation!\n\nWant to explore which style works best in different situations?",
